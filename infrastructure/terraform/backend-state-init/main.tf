==============================================================================
Backend State Init: Terraform Remote State Infrastructure
==============================================================================
Provisions bootstrap resources for Terraform remote state:
- S3 bucket for state storage with versioning and encryption
- DynamoDB table for state locking
- Public access blocks for security

Note: This module's state is stored locally. It exists as a separate bootstrap
workspace that must be applied before the main infrastructure. Remote state
isn't strictly required for a personal project, but demonstrates production
practices: state locking prevents concurrent modifications, versioning enables
rollback, and centralized storage supports team collaboration and CI/CD.
